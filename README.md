# About

This repo has been created to generate ready to use data files around the Collatz Conjecture. As I
wanted to learn more about these patterns, I needed to generate some custom files.

Finally I developed a first draft, a generator that makes the job at least for my first experimentations.

# Usage

To play with these files, you have two options :

- use ready to use samples
- generate your owns

## Ready to use samples

Ready to use samples are stored in `samples` directory. The directorories are organized
as follow : `${lower-bound}_${upper_bound}`.

So, the `-1000_1000` directory contains sample where seeds are between `-1000` and `1000`.

## Generate your own samples

The code is organized as a JBang script, so all you have to do to install :

## Install JBang

Linux :

```
sdk install jbang
choco install jbang
```

Windows :

```
choco install jbang
```
## Generate your own sample

```shell
git clone https://github.com/adriens/JCollatz.git
cd JCollatz
# Use -666 as lower seed and 666 as upper seed
jbang Collatz.java -l -666 -u 666
```
